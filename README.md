## Experience building this project

I had too many problems Deploying these apps to heroku and netlify, I made like 40 commits just to solving problems, but finally, my apps work correctly.

I learned too much because never before I had worked with images in node.js and never before I had Deployed an API in heroku.

### I learned

- Manage files with Node.js
- Save images in host [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
- Deploy an API in heroku
- Give style to input type file
- Make a loader
